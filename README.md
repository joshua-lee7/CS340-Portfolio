1. How do I approach designing software?
   For me developing software has everything to do with understanding the requirements of the project you are working on and breaking it down into a modular piece by piece solutions. Projects differ in size and will have different requirements but understanding each individual task that needs to be done and piecemealing a solution one step at a time and testing each module as you go is absolutely key.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
  Very similarly developing programs has everything to do with understanding the material you need to complete the given task and breaking it down into small pieces and testing those individual pieces along the way. This makes it such that your program is made of a lot of small but durable parts that are also interchangeable if they need to be changed or fixed in the future.
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   The ideaologies within Computer Science have helped me learn a significant amount about completing any large task. The underlying idea is that any large task is usually an amalgomation of small tasks built up and it is way easier to chip away at a large goal than try to complete the whole thing at once. This also helps with time management because it makes me think of Agile development where work is done in sprints and when that sprint is over you are done working on what you were working with last sprint and its on to the next task because you're trying to chip away at the greater goal at hand.
